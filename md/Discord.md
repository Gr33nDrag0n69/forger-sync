Hi Liskers,

This message is for all forging delegates on mainnet & testnet.

After multiple hours building my private copy on testnet, testing the code, creating a public version, writing a full README for easy usage, etc.

**I'm proud to present:**

I highly encourage you to at least give a look to the README, I think it's something that can be very useful to every forging delegates.
